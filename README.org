I would like to have something like Obsidian Canvas for Org mode.

See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10ws9z4/canvas_has_completely_changed_obsidian_for_me_now/][this thread on Reddit]] for an example of Obsidian Canvas.

At the moment, this is what I have in mind:

- IN-PROGRESS: Use the org-element API to parse a =*.canvas.org= file.
- Serve the parsed representation via =simple-httpd=.
- Frontend part renders notes with edges. I have built various HTML proofs of concept.
